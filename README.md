# Cotton-Plant-Disease-Detection-
**Cotton Plant Disease Detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
**Cottom Plant Disease Detection Android Mobile Application**

  The objective of this project is to utilize the complete mobile sensing capabilities of Android smartphones to develop a powerful tool for the diagnosis of diseases in cotton plants. Our approach involves building a lightweight machine-learning model that integrates a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and advanced image processing techniques. Through our innovative solution, we aim to empower farmers and researchers with a user-friendly and reliable means of detecting and managing cotton plant diseases, leveraging the accessibility and versatility of mobile technology.
