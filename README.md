# Cotton-Plant-Disease-Detection-
**Cotton Plant Disease Detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
**Cottom Plant Disease Detection Android Mobile Application**

  The goal of this research project is to develop an Android mobile application that can detect cotton plant diseases using image processing techniques and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The application will allow users to take a photo or select an image from their gallery, which will be processed and compared to a pre-trained CNN model to determine if the plant is diseased. The team plans to create an accurate detection algorithm with a user-friendly interface for farmers to use on the go. This project aims to simplify the process of disease identification in cotton plants and ultimately benefit local cotton farmers and researchers.
