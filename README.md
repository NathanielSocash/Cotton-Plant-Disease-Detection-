# Cotton-Plant-Disease-Detection-
**Cotton Plant Disease Detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

  This project seeks to build a machine-learning model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and image processing to diagnose cotton plants with specific diseases, paired with a comparative analysis of different image processing algorithms. We aim to build a functional model and port this model to a working android mobile app for the benefit of farmers and researchers.
